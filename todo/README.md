# ToDo (beta)

> v0.1.1  

Small command line application for managing your tasks in a very easy way.

(Still a couple of problems.)

> No executable nor package yet. 
> 
> I use the program with a (z)shell script that starts a virtual environment and then executes the python script.
>
> You can find a template of the script in temp/todo_shell_script.sh.
> Do not forget to put in your virtual environment; and make sure the dependencies (see requirements.txt) are installed.
